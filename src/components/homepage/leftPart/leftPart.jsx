          The Forte Lurex Linen Viscose Jacket in Mother of Pearl features lunar
          lavishness by night and by day: a blazer in a linen blend shot with
          lurex for a shimmering surface that shines like a star in the sky. it
          has a straight fit with well defined shoulders and a shawl collar
          culminating in a button and has been flawlessly finished with three
          jet pockets with a sartorial feel. <br /><br /> See the <a href="#">EDITORâ€™S NOTE</a> <br /><br />{" "}
